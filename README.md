# My Portfolio âœ¨

Hello! I am Ivana JimÃ©nez, I'm currently studying my first semester of Computer Engineering at the Centro Universitario de los Altos of the University of Guadalajara, here's where my journey as a programmer begins.

## What have I learned? ðŸ“š

1. **C programming language**: I'm just discovering how this language works (what I do best is commenting the code, I can barely print something).
2. **flowcharts**: I try to plan before programming using flowcharts (they're poorly designed and have no output).

## Personal Goals ðŸŽ¯
I know that I'm just starting out and that it's normal to make mistakes, however I always try to practice and look for alternatives to improve my skills. I would love to work remotely as a software developer in the future!
